Nbody Simulations of Self Confining Ringlets

Nbody simulations are used to explore whether narrow eccentric planetary rings might be self confining. In our experiments, the epi_int_lite Nbody code is used to evolve a viscous and self-gravitating ringlet that is represented as a pair of gravitating streamlines that interact via their mutual gravities and viscous friction. We find that the streamline's secular gravitational perturbations causes the streamline's eccentricity gradient e'=a(de/da) to grow over time while the ringlet's internal friction causes the streamlines to spread radially. And in certain circumstances, the simulated ringlet's eccentricity gradient approaches the critical value e'=√3/2=0.877, which zeros the orbit-averaged viscous torque that adjacent streamlines exert on each other (Borderies et al 1982). When that happens, the simulated ringlet's radial spreading slows dramatically but is not entirely halted. Rather, our simulated ringlet still spreads albeit very slowly while executing low-amplitude librations about the equilibrium state described in Borderies et al (1983). So our simulations show that a ringlet's secular gravitational perturbations can drive an unconfined viscous ringlet very close to the e'=√3/2=0.877 threshold, which suggests that  narrow eccentric planetary rings might be self-confining without the need for any shepherd satellites. But it is unclear today whether the low-amplitude libration and slow spreading seen in our simulation is real or somehow an artifact of subtleties in the epi_int_lite code or choice of initial conditions.
